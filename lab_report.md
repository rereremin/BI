# Lab report
## Dead Manâ€™s Teeth. Introduction to metagenomics analysis
### Amplicon sequencing
We used a script written in the R. You shuold find it [here](https://github.com/rereremin/BI/tree/project7/scripts)

In one of the steps, a table with information on fastq files was obtained. This table contains the total number of reeds in the file, the number of filtered reeds and the number of non-chimeric reeds. Table [here](https://github.com/rereremin/BI/tree/project7/results).

As a result of executing this script we have 4 files, which we need for [MicrobiomeAnalyst](). Results of this step [here](https://github.com/rereremin/BI/tree/project7/results)
